List.c : Contains doubly linked list ADT. Graph.c uses lists to represent 
         adjacency of vertexes in graph and as stack for BFS, Queue for getPath

List.h : Header file for List.c

Graph.c : ADT representing a graph. Vertex adj. list representation represented
          by linked lists. Contains Breadth-First Search function.

Graph.h : Header file for Graph.c

GraphTest.c : Tests functionality of Graph.c 

FindPath.c : Takes name of input and output file. Input file provides vertices
             and edges for Graph. Prints adj. list representation of Graph and
             selected shortest paths.

Makefile: Compiles executable file  Lex from Lex.c and List.c and List.h
