List.java : Contains doubly linked list ADT. Matrix.java uses Lists as rows in
            n*n Matrix

ListTest.java : Tests functioning of List.java

Matrix.java: Contains array of linked lists Matrix ADT. Used by Sparse to 
             build Matrices and perform Matrix operations

MatrixTest.java : Tests functioning of Matrix.java

Sparse.java : Takes in name of input and output file as arguments. Builds 
              Matrices from input text file. Performs Matrix operations
              and outputs results to output file.
