List.c : Contains doubly linked list ADT. Graph.c uses lists to represent 
         adjacency of vertexes in graph and contains DFS algorithm

List.h : Header file for List.c

Graph.c : ADT representing a graph. Vertex adj. list representation represented
          by linked lists. Contains Depth-First Search function.

Graph.h : Header file for Graph.c

GraphTest.c : Tests functionality of Graph.c 

FindComponents.c : Takes name of input and output file. Input file provides 
                   vertices and edges for Graph. Prints adj. list 
                   representation of Graph and strongly connected components

Makefile: Compiles executable file  Lex from Lex.c and List.c and List.h
